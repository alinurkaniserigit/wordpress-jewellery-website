#. Description of the theme
msgid "The 2010 theme for WordPress is stylish, customizable, simple, and readable -- make it yours with a custom menu, header image, and background. Twenty Ten supports six widgetized areas (two in the sidebar, four in the footer) and featured images (thumbnails for gallery posts and custom header images for posts and pages). It includes stylesheets for print and the admin Visual Editor, special styles for posts in the \"Asides\" and \"Gallery\" categories, and has an optional one-column page template that removes the sidebar."

My partner and I decided to take a long weekend and stay in a cabin in the woods. We packed up after work on Friday and drove out into the country, passing through fields full of horses, old farms, and quaint little town squares. It was an idyllic drive. Eventually, we reached our destination and unpacked the car. We couldn’t wait to cook up a simple dinner and then relax by the fireplace."
